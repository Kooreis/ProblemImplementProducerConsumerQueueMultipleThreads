JavaScript is a single-threaded language, meaning it doesn't support multi-threading in the traditional sense. However, it does support asynchronous programming, which can be used to achieve similar results. Here's a simple implementation of a producer-consumer queue using JavaScript's async/await syntax:

```javascript
class Queue {
    constructor() {
        this.queue = [];
        this.isProcessing = false;
    }

    enqueue(item) {
        this.queue.push(item);
        this.process();
    }

    async process() {
        if (this.queue.length > 0 && !this.isProcessing) {
            this.isProcessing = true;
            let item = this.queue.shift();
            await this.consume(item);
            this.isProcessing = false;
            this.process();
        }
    }

    async consume(item) {
        // Simulate processing time
        return new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(() => {
            console.log(`Consumed: ${item}`);
            resolve();
        }, Math.random() * 1000));
    }
}

let queue = new Queue();

// Simulate producers
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    setTimeout(() => {
        console.log(`Produced: ${i}`);
        queue.enqueue(i);
    }, Math.random() * 1000);
}
```

In this code, the `Queue` class represents the producer-consumer queue. The `enqueue` method is used to add items to the queue, and the `process` method is used to consume items from the queue. The `consume` method simulates the time it takes to process an item.

The code at the bottom simulates multiple producers adding items to the queue at random intervals. The queue processes items as they are added, but only one item can be processed at a time.
