TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript and runs on a single thread, which means it doesn't support multi-threading like other languages such as Java or C#. However, you can simulate a producer-consumer queue using Promises and async/await.

Here is a simple implementation of a producer-consumer queue in TypeScript:

```typescript
class Queue<T> {
    private _store: T[] = [];

    push(val: T) {
        this._store.push(val);
    }

    pop(): T | undefined {
        return this._store.shift();
    }
}

class Producer {
    private queue: Queue<number>;

    constructor(queue: Queue<number>) {
        this.queue = queue;
    }

    async produce() {
        let i = 0;
        while (true) {
            await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 1000));
            this.queue.push(i);
            console.log(`Produced: ${i}`);
            i++;
        }
    }
}

class Consumer {
    private queue: Queue<number>;

    constructor(queue: Queue<number>) {
        this.queue = queue;
    }

    async consume() {
        while (true) {
            await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 1000));
            const value = this.queue.pop();
            if (value !== undefined) {
                console.log(`Consumed: ${value}`);
            }
        }
    }
}

const queue = new Queue<number>();
const producer = new Producer(queue);
const consumer = new Consumer(queue);

producer.produce();
consumer.consume();
```

In this code, we have a `Queue` class that represents a simple queue data structure. We also have `Producer` and `Consumer` classes that produce and consume values from the queue, respectively. The `produce` and `consume` methods are asynchronous and use `setTimeout` to simulate the delay of producing and consuming.
